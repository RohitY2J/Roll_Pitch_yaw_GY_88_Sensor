# Roll_Pitch_yaw_GY_88_Sensor

It consists of arduino code for calculating the roll pitch and yaw from the accelerometer and magnetometer data. 
Though the code successfully calculates the roll pitch and yawa value from the raw reading, the unit/LSB has to be changed to match the 
accelerometer and magnetometer you are using. Also another problem is, it is using uncalibrated data for calculation of roll pitch and yaw.
Thus calibration has to be done by yourself.
